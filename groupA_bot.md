# SDS Chatbot

- Cocky bot that doesn't want to help the player
- Exits on itself using `exit()`
- Deletes itself (doesn't want to have anything to do with the player)
- Compiled binary so that the next team has to reverse engineer the binary in order to get the source code (or ask politely only for the bot to print some random rubbish code)
- Gives wrong source assembly code to player
- You have to write the end of the chatbot yourself
